# Floods-Prediction-Models
risks associated with floods this model proposes a system that utilizes both machine learning and deep learning techniques to improve flood prediction. The system employs Support Vector Regression (SVR), Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP), Linear Regression, and Logistic Regression techniques. 
# Dataset-description
About Dataset Flood detection refers to the process of identifying, monitoring, and alerting authorities or individuals about the presence or likelihood of flooding in a particular area. It involves the use of various technologies and methods to detect, predict, and mitigate the impacts of floods.The dataset comprises approximately five thousand rows and twenty columns. With each row representing a specific flood event and each column representing the features and factors that affect flood occurrence. These attributes are monsoonlntensity, topography drainage, river management, deforestation, urbanization, climate change, dams quality, siltation, agricultural practices, encroachments, ineffective disaster preparedness, drainage systems, coastal vulnerability, landslides, watersheds deteriorating infrastructure, population score, wetland loss, inadequate planning, political factors.
